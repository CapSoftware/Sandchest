# Getting Started

This guide walks you through installing the SDK, configuring authentication, and running your first command inside a Sandchest sandbox.

## Install the SDK

```bash
bun add @sandchest/sdk
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install @sandchest/sdk
```

## Set your API key

Create an API key in the [Sandchest dashboard](https://sandchest.com/dashboard) and export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export SANDCHEST_API_KEY=sk_your_api_key_here
```

The SDK reads `SANDCHEST_API_KEY` automatically. You can also pass it explicitly when constructing the client.

## Create and run a sandbox

```ts
import { Sandchest } from '@sandchest/sdk'

const sandchest = new Sandchest()

// Create a sandbox and wait for it to be ready
const sandbox = await sandchest.create()

// Execute a command
const result = await sandbox.exec('echo "Hello from Sandchest!"')
console.log(result.stdout) // "Hello from Sandchest!\n"
console.log(result.exitCode) // 0

// Clean up
await sandbox.stop()
```

That is all it takes. The SDK handles polling for readiness, retry logic, and cleanup.

## Using the CLI

If you prefer working from the terminal, the Sandchest CLI provides the same capabilities:

```bash
bun add -g @sandchest/cli

sandchest create
sandchest exec <sandbox-id> -- echo "Hello from Sandchest!"
sandchest stop <sandbox-id>
```
