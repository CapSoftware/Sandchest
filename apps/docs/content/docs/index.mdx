description: Linux sandbox platform for AI agent code execution powered by Firecracker microVMs.
---

Sandchest is a Linux sandbox platform purpose-built for AI agent code execution. Every sandbox is a [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) microVM with VM-grade isolation, sub-second fork capability, and a permanent session replay URL.

## Key capabilities

- **VM-grade isolation** -- Each sandbox runs in its own Firecracker microVM with a dedicated kernel, memory, and filesystem. No container escape surface.
- **Sub-second fork** -- Snapshot the full state of a running sandbox and fork it into independent copies. Branch execution paths without re-running setup.
- **Session replay** -- Every sandbox gets a permanent replay URL. Review the full execution history of any sandbox after the fact.
- **File system access** -- Upload and download files to and from sandboxes. Register build artifacts for retrieval after the sandbox stops.
- **Stateful sessions** -- Open persistent shell sessions that maintain working directory, environment variables, and process state between commands.
