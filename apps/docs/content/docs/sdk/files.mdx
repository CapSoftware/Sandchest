File operations are available on the `sandbox.fs` namespace.

## Upload a file

```ts
const content = new TextEncoder().encode('console.log("hello")')
await sandbox.fs.upload('/work/index.js', content)
```

Files are uploaded as `Uint8Array`. Use `TextEncoder` for text content.

## Upload a directory

Upload a tar archive that gets extracted at the target path:

```ts
await sandbox.fs.uploadDir('/work', tarballBytes)
```

## Download a file

```ts
const bytes = await sandbox.fs.download('/work/output.json')
const text = new TextDecoder().decode(bytes)
const data = JSON.parse(text)
```

## List files

```ts
const entries = await sandbox.fs.ls('/work')
for (const entry of entries) {
  console.log(entry.name, entry.type, entry.size_bytes)
}
```

Each entry has:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | File or directory name |
| `path` | `string` | Full path |
| `type` | `'file' \| 'directory'` | Entry type |
| `size_bytes` | `number` | Size in bytes |

## Delete a file

```ts
await sandbox.fs.rm('/work/temp.txt')
```
