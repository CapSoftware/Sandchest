description: VM-grade isolation via Firecracker microVMs.
---

Sandchest provides VM-grade isolation for every sandbox. Each sandbox runs in its own Firecracker microVM — the same technology used by AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.

## Isolation model

Unlike containers, which share the host kernel, each Sandchest sandbox runs in a **separate virtual machine** with its own:

- Linux kernel
- Memory space
- Filesystem
- Network namespace
- Process tree

There is no shared kernel surface between sandboxes.

## Firecracker microVMs

[Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) designed for running many lightweight VMs on a single host:

- Minimal attack surface — stripped-down device model
- Fast boot — VMs start in milliseconds
- Memory-efficient — no overhead from running a full hypervisor
- Proven — powers billions of AWS Lambda invocations

## Network isolation

Each sandbox has its own network namespace. Sandboxes cannot communicate with each other or with the host network directly. Outbound internet access is available for package installation and repository cloning.

## Ephemeral by default

Sandboxes are ephemeral. When stopped or destroyed, all data is removed. Only registered artifacts and replay data persist beyond the sandbox lifetime.

## What this means for you

- Run untrusted code safely — sandbox processes cannot escape the VM
- No risk of cross-contamination between sandboxes
- Full root access inside the sandbox without host risk
- AI agents can execute arbitrary code without security concerns
