title: Session Replay
description: How replay works and how to share replay links.
---

Every Sandchest sandbox gets a permanent replay URL that records everything that happened — every command, its output, and file changes.

## How it works

Events are recorded in real-time as commands execute in the sandbox:

- Command input and arguments
- Standard output and standard error
- Exit codes and durations
- File system changes
- Session state transitions

These events are stored durably and can be replayed at any time.

## Accessing replays

Every sandbox has a `replayUrl` property:

```ts
const sandbox = await sandchest.create()
console.log(sandbox.replayUrl) // https://sandchest.com/replay/...
```

Via the CLI:

```bash
sandchest replay sb_abc123
sandchest replay sb_abc123 --open  # opens in browser
```

## Replay persistence

Replay URLs are permanent. They remain accessible after the sandbox is stopped or destroyed. You can share them freely — they are read-only views of what happened.

## Use cases

| Use case | How |
|----------|-----|
| Debugging | Share the replay URL in a bug report |
| Code review | Link to the replay showing test runs |
| Documentation | Embed replay links in guides |
| Auditing | Review what an agent did in a sandbox |
| Teaching | Share step-by-step command sequences |
